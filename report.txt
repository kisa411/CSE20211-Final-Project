The purpose of this project was to create a simulation of the game "Tamagotchi".
From the programmer's perspective, there are different functions for incrementing 
each status bar as well as for decrementing each status bar. There are also functions
that display the appropriate graphics, and there is also a function to check if any 
of the bars have gone down to 0 (aka. to check if the game should end). We also had
functions to display our menu and status bar, and another function that would 
return a specific value depending on where the user clicked. The bulk of 
our project was dealing with the graphics and making sure that the right pictures 
showed up for each scene. Inside main, we have a swich-case statement to control 
which screen is displayed depending on where the user clicks. 

From the user's perspective, the screen initially displays an intro scene where it 
says click to continue. Once the user clicks anywhere on the screen, the user can
then chose to feed, water, play, clean, or sleep. For each button the image will
change and the status bars will be adjusted accordingly. There is also a quit button
if the user ever wants to quit. If any of the bars end up reaching 0, the pet will 
die, and an ending scene that displays "YOUR PET DIED" shows up, and if you click
the program ends. We wanted to add more animations of the pet, but because the 
images loaded so slowly, we could not. 

We verified the program's correctness by testing it multiple times. We made sure the 
goodbye scene displayed properly each time a bar reached 0, and we made sure that the
bars adjusted properly. Sometimes the images show up very slowly.
